# **Image Restoration using GAN and ResNet + GAN**

Both models aim to **remove noise (salt-and-pepper noise) from images** and **restore lost details**, improving overall image quality.

## **Project Structure**
- `GAN.py` → A basic **GAN-based image restoration model**, trained for **100 epochs** but with room for improvement.
- `hybrid.py` → A **ResNet + GAN hybrid model**, leveraging **residual blocks** to improve noise removal and detail restoration.

## **Features**
✔️ Adds **salt-and-pepper noise** to images  
✔️ Uses **GANs** to denoise and reconstruct images  
✔️ Implements **ResNet-based residual blocks** for better feature preservation  
✔️ Compares the performance of **GAN vs. ResNet + GAN**  
✔️ Measures **PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio)** for performance evaluation  

## **Dataset**
- **CIFAR-10 dataset** is used for training and evaluation.
- Noisy images are generated by **adding salt-and-pepper noise** with different probabilities.

## **Installation**
To set up the environment and dependencies, run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/timec21/machine-learning-classification
cd image-restoration
